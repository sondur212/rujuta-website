          The aim of this project was to be able to express human emotions
          through inanimate objects without relying on more human
          characteristics such as facial expressions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that in the future technology will not be limited to solely
          voice or screen interactions but will also rely on the form of the
          object for communication.

          We tried representing some emotions with a ball as our object. Since
          it is such a simple object we felt that it would force us to focus
          more on the movement and form.

          We also tried to express emotions using a belt as an object, as it

          We tried to narrow down a framework for some basic human emotions and
          tried to identify some parameters of that emotion. These included
          speed, duration, direction and quality of movement

          We displayed twelve of these animations at an exhibition in the
          Rangoli Metro Station in Bangalore to find out peopleâ€™s response to
          the animations. We asked them what emotion they were able to recognise
          from the animations and whether they could envision this method of
          communication from objects like Alexa or Google Home in the future.
          There were mixed answers from people about the emotions. Some emotions
          like happy or sad were easy for people to understand, but the more
          nuanced emotions like embarrassment were harder to identify.
